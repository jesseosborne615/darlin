    <p1>There's unity in catastrophe<br>And if you're wondering that's you and me<br>
        There's hopelessness or there's owning this<br>
        Cause there's a million different things that love could be<br><br>
        Thank your lucky stars<br>
        For all those goddamn scars<br>Like a map that makes a winding road<br>
        Leading you all the way back home<br>
        I thank my lucky stars<br>
        For your perfect heart<br>The pounding beat leads to the unknown<br>
        Showing me that this is where I'm home<br>Welcome home<br><br>
        There's sanctity from these atrocities<br>And hey guess what? That's you and me<br>
        Cause I'm always there and I'm always waiting<br>
        And I will be whatever you need<br><br>
        Thank your lucky stars<br>
        For all those goddamn scars<br>Like a map that makes a winding road<br>
        Leading you all the way back home<br>
        I thank my lucky stars<br>
        For your perfect heart<br>The pounding beat leads to the unknown<br>
        Showing me that this is where I'm home<br>Welcome home<br><br>
